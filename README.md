# 🧠 Facial Age Detection Using AI

This project explores the use of Artificial Intelligence techniques — including CNN, ANN, SVM, and Random Forest — to build an age detection model that predicts whether a person is **young**, **middle-aged**, or **old** based on facial features.

Developed as part of the *Artificial Intelligence – Real World Problem Solving* course at Bournemouth University.
